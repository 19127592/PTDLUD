Perfect for a couple looking to stay somewhere they can cook and relax. The apartment has everything you need, even a bath and washing machine. The only thing I would mention is the balcony being a bit dirty, however the view into the gardens is quite nice.

Two tram lines just a block from the apartment make it easy to get anywhere in the city and we enjoyed being in a real neighborhood away from the more crowded tourist areas. We did several day trips and found using the nearby Sloterdijk Railway Station very convenient.  There are plenty of good restaurants nearby as well as two grocery stores.  The apartment itself is large, clean, airly and bright.  There is an amazing amount of space for a big city apartment.  Great shower (and large tub) and comfortable bed.  The French doors in the kitchen overlook a charming garden and there is a balcony for outdoor space.  The front of the apartment faces a street, but there was very little traffic and it was always quiet.  Communication with Nicoline was easy and she promptly responded to any questions.

"Hello stranger, 
I am a Marketing lecturer for the University of Applied Sciences (Hogeschool van Amsterdam) and now living in Amsterdam for about 12 years. Just moved to the west at this lovely place I call my home. 
I love to make people feel welcome and I love to make sure people are enjoying Amsterdam, one of the best cities in the world! When you book my place, there is a pack of Dutch 'stroopwafels' for you waiting ;-).
Haven't been really active on Airbnb, as you can see, but planning to rent my place out more often this year. Please feel welcome to ask me anything you want, and let's see if I can provide it.

Cheers,
Jerry","29 Reviews","Identity verified","Jerry","false","true","https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/13744875","13744875","false",,,,,,"Joined in March 2014","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/c425feca-f8e4-4268-9811-8280603ba771.jpg?aki_policy=profile_large",,,"Jerry","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/c425feca-f8e4-4268-9811-8280603ba771.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","Brianna","true","251895816","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/924843fb-8605-4411-a2b7-6cf01b508428.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","Brianna","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/924843fb-8605-4411-a2b7-6cf01b508428.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small",,"Very clean and bright!

Jeroen's apartment met all of these requirements.   When I arrived, his parents met me and welcomed me to his lovely flat. Also, he left a map, and a pack of stroopwafel (an Amsterdam treat) and a handwritten card welcoming me to the city. The apartment was quite spacious and has a great floor plan. The bed was large and quite comfortable. There is storage in the bedroom for guests. <br/><br/>There is an enormous amount of natural light, and he has a patio where one can sit and sip tea in the morning. His apartment is located in a beautiful, hip and diverse neighborhood close to the city center. <br/><br/>Grocery and Stores: There are several stores, a bakery, coffee shops and restaurants within a 6-minute walk from his flat. Every day I would walk to Albert Heijn and purchase some freshly baked croissants and juice. The store offers an assortment of meals that you can cook at home. There's also a drugstore called Kruidavit close to the market.  If you are looking for a gym, there is a gym on the other side of the flat which offers a free week trial membership.<br/><br/>Transportation: As you may know a majority of people in Amsterdam commute by bike. You can rent a bike, or catch the tram or bus. The bus is located one block over (a 2-minute walk), and the tram is three blocks away (6-minute walk). The #13 and #14 tram will take you to the Dam and other tourist areas and Central Station.  You can also take a casual walk from the flat. It should take 40-45 minutes and is quite lovely and scenic.<br/><br/>Communication: While I did not have the pleasure to meet Jeroen, he was always available to answer questions via WhatsApp and AirBnB. He was always pleasant and patient with me. He would also occasionally send me a message to check on me. <br/><br/>Additional Info: The sun sets quite late in Amsterdam in the summer. On most nights, it wouldn't get dark until 11:00 pm. Bring an eye mask.<br/><br/>I had a great time at Jeroen's and would rebook whenever visiting the city. I highly recommend his flat for short term and long term stays. He is a great and genorous host. <br/>","2017-07-07T09:11:26Z","167489276",,"July 2017",,,,,,"5","Jeroen","true","59054356","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/49617c39-4aeb-4919-8549-fc9a6bab5a37.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","Jeroen","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/49617c39-4aeb-4919-8549-fc9a6bab5a37.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","Thank you so much Tina!

Karen was very welcoming and warmed the apartment with cookies and beverages. Communication before and during our stay was immediate and made us feel safe and secure. The apartment was spotless and decorated/designed with cool art and furnishings. We felt very much in our own space and in a quiet apartment all to ourselves.

The website photos looked good and we weren't disappointed. It was spotless and roomy. The bathroom was large with everything we needed. <br/>I went with my daughter Lucy and Petra made up the beds as singles.  She gave us great information about getting to her place from the airport and about a travel ticket for the trams and trains. That all worked so smoothly which took any strain from the journey.  <br/>She also told us about an AMAZING patisserie called Pompadour.  It was about to close the first time we found it but we went back the next day. It was so worthwhile!!!! <br/>Petra also came to lucy's rescue when she realised her dresses were so creased from the travel by Ironing them for her. How kind was that! <br/>Thanks Petra for adding so much to our trip.

Upon arrival, we noted the online photos were just like the rooms.  Both rooms are nice.  Room 1 is preferable, as it has large windows that opened to a pleasant view into the tree tops and down into the courtyard below to watch children at play, locals walking dogs, and patrons enjoying an evening meal across the street.<br/><br/>The rooms/bathrooms are clean and modern, light and bright, and have tall ceilings for a spacious feel. The beds are comfortable, the sheets/blankets are soft, and there are multiple pillows to find the right fit. A rare find - a room with many power outlets.  As part of the service, rooms are cleaned daily and coffee/tea/cream/sugar/bottled water/bedside chocolate are provided.<br/><br/>The only downside is temporary construction on two nearby buildings that begins weekdays only at 7am. This is scheduled to complete in July.  It’s an annoyance, yet didn’t deter from the enjoyment of our stay.<br/><br/>The hostess is warm, welcoming and accommodating.  It's clear she works hard to ensure her guests have a wonderful stay.  Her suggestions for shopping and restaurants were right on target.  I highly recommend this BnB, if you're looking for a location right on Vondelpark, on the tram line, near several grocery stores, and in a family friendly neighborhood with a local feel - this is the place.","2017-06-17T06:32:42Z","161134064",,"June 2017",,,,,,"5","Petra","true","55288093","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/94f83fa2-5518-48f3-9962-4a8a0a9e42d7.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","Petra","https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/94f83fa2-5518-48f3-9962-4a8a0a9e42d7.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","Thank you Jenny, mvg Petra","Adele","true","9116831","https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/9116831/profile_pic/1380472563/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","Adele","https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/9116831/profile_pic/1380472563/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small",,"This appartment is a true gem.
